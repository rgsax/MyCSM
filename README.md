A very short guide to get started:

```
_.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._ STEP1 _.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._
```

Before starting the project, to make everything work,
you need to add these 4 lines at the end of the file to the hosts file 
(reachable in Windows at path: "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc" and on Linux/MacOS at : "/etc/hosts"):

```sh
127.0.0.1	mycsm
127.0.0.1	analogocean
127.0.0.1	avuesse
127.0.0.1	mircosoftazzure
```

You also need to install the required library of "requirements.txt".
They can be easily installed using Pip

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
_.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._ STEP2 _.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._.~"~._
```

Windows environment: 

1. Start "launch_app.bat" : The application will be reachable at https://mycsm:5000
2. Start "app_launcher.py": The application will be reachable at 
    - https://mircosoftazzure:4444
    - https://avuesse:5555
    - https://analogocean:8888

Linux environment: 

1. Start "launch_app.sh" : The application will be reachable at https://mycsm:5000
2. Start "app_launcher.py": The application will be reachable at 
    - https://mircosoftazzure:4444
    - https://avuesse:5555
    - https://analogocean:8888
